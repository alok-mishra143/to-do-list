# To-Do List Project

## Overview

The To-Do List project is a simple web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to create and manage their daily tasks. The project incorporates a typewriter effect for a unique user experience and utilizes browser cookies to store the to-do list, ensuring persistence across sessions.

## Features

- **Intuitive Interface:** The user-friendly interface makes it easy for users to add, edit, and remove tasks from their to-do list.
  
- **Typewriter Effect:** A typewriter effect adds a dynamic and engaging element to the user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Cookie Storage:** The to-do list is stored in the browser's cookies, allowing users to access their tasks even after closing and reopening the browser.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The project structure is built using HTML to create a clear and semantic layout.

- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets are employed for styling the user interface, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design.

- **JavaScript:** The logic behind adding, editing, and removing tasks, as well as the typewriter effect, is implemented using JavaScript.

- **Typewriter Effect CDN:** The typewriter effect is achieved by integrating a typewriter library using a Content Delivery Network (CDN), providing efficient and reliable access to the required resources.
